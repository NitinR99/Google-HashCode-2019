array <- for library scores
libraryScore <- variable, calculated using [(booksTotal * shippingCap) / signupDays ] + pointsAvailInLib
Queue <- for which lib to signup and what order

while(days remaining)

for each library: calculate/update score based on what books have already been scanned

if (lib with highest score.signUpDays < daysRemaining)
            then queue that library

else (try next library until we find one that we can queue and get points out of before time runs out)

then retry the while look
